# Freya Blekman

Freya is a professor of physics in Belgium. Her research interests include the search for new physics, such as supersymmetry (SUSY), using precision measurements and direct searches with a focus on new particles that transform into top quarks after being produced. She has led many research teams at CERN and CMS, including the Beyond-Two-Generations (B2G) Physics Analysis Group of CMS. In 2013, Freya was involved with the LHC Physics Center at Fermilab as a LPC distinguished researcher.
