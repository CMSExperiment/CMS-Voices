# Toyoko Orimoto

Toyoko is an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University. She received her bachelor’s degree and PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied CP violation with the Babar Experiment. She joined the CMS Collaboration in 2006 as the Robert A. Millikan fellow at the California Institute of Technology. Her research is focused on the operation and upgrade of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter, and searches for new physics, especially exotic production and decay of the Higgs boson.

Toyoko is passionate about advocating for diversity and inclusion in science and ensuring that careers in physics are accessible to all. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with her family, which includes two small children, and the family of friends that she’s made at CERN.
