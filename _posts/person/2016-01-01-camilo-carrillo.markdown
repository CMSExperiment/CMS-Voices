# Camilo Carrillo

Camilo is Colombian/French and has been working for CMS since 2006, right now as a post-doctoral researcher for the Institut de Physique Nucléaire de Lyon in France. Currently he is searching for a second Higgs boson, lighter than the one already observed. He has long experience in the detector performance studies of the Muon System and in the search for Heavy Stable Charged Particles.
