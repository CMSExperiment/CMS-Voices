# Tommaso Dorigo

Tommaso is a member of CMS since 2001. He previously worked on the CDF experiment at the Tevatron, where he learned how hadron colliders work and how to squeeze their data for physics results. He lives in Venice and works for the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics -- *Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare* (INFN) -- in Padova, where he focuses on Higgs physics and machine learning.

Tommaso has been blogging on particle physics since 2005 (blog now at [www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor](http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor)) and is active in science outreach; he recently published the book "[Anomaly! Collider physics and the quest for new phenomena at Fermilab](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/q0032)".
