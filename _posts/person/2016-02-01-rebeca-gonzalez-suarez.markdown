# Rebeca Gonzalez Suarez

Rebeca is from Asturias, Spain, but moved to Geneva, where she still lives, in 2008. During her PhD she prepared the search for the Higgs boson before data arrived. Today she continues studying the Higgs boson, now with data, and also the top quark, the heaviest elementary particle known. She is a postdoc at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.

She has worked on the DT Muon chambers, the silicon strip Tracker, and the generation of simulated samples. Rebeca is also a CMS guide.
