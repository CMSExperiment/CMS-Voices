# Alexander Morton

Alexander is a Doctoral Candidate in Nuclear and Particle Physics at Brunel University London. Born and raised in the United Kingdom, he received a *Master in Science* degree in Physics at Imperial College London.

During his undergraduate years he became involved with a proposed Tracking Trigger upgrade for the CMS detector as part of his Mastersâ€™ project. This work has continued into his PhD years in addition to working on searches for rare processes involving a single top quark (the heaviest fundamental particle known). Alexander also contributes to CMS by undertaking a number of on-call, online and offline shifts and writing part of the DQM/Validation software for the Phase I Pixel detector.

Outside of academic life, Alexander has continued to enjoy singing with the Imperial College Choir (sitting as a committee member during 2013-2014), indulged in being a self-confessed political junkie and travelling (where possible by train, especially if it is steam-hauled).
