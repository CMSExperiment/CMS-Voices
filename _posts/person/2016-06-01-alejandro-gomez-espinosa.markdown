# Alejandro Gomez Espinosa

Originally from Quito, Ecuador, where he got his bachelor's degree, Alejandro is a graduate student in physics at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. He has been working for CMS since 2011, when he did his undergraduate project at the LHC Physics Center at Fermilab. He visited CERN for the first time as a Summer Student in 2012, where he witnessed first hand the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson. After that, he moved to New Jersey to start his PhD programme and has been living in Geneva for a year.

Alejandro is involved in searches for new physics with exotic particles decaying into jets, especially high-momentum jets with an internal structure. He enjoys participating in outreach activities, in particular ones concerning the involvement of minorities in science.
