# Andrés G. Delannoy

Andrés is a CERN-based postdoctoral researcher with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He has been a part of the CMS Collaboration since 2007. Born and raised in Puerto Rico, he completed his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. He then embarked on a PhD in physics at Vanderbilt University where he worked on searches for supersymmetry involving tau leptons, the first LHC search for dark matter using the Vector-Boson Fusion signature (accepted by PRL), firmware development for the Pixel Tracker, and commissioning and operation of the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (a silicon-pixel detector dedicated to luminosity measurement at CMS). Currently, he is the operations manager for the Pixel Luminosity Telescope.
