# Matt Bellis

I grew up in Jupiter, Florida (USA) and always wanted to be some sort of scientist. I went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) for undergrad Physics, but when I graduated I was more into making music. So for the next four years, I worked in a music store selling guitars and played in a variety of bands. After that, I worked for General Electric working on natural gas turbines for two years, before I realised I \*really\* missed physics. I went back to RPI for my PhD on baryon resonances, and continued that work for a post-doc at Carnegie Mellon University before moving to Stanford as a post-doc on the BaBar experiment. I taught and did research at Northern Illinois University for a year before moving to Siena College and joining CMS, in collaboration with the Cornell University HEP group.
