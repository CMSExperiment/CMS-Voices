# Suchita Kulkarni

Suchita is an associate theorist with CMS since July 2016. She investigates the problem of dark matter. She uses experimental results to understand the viability of dark-matter scenarios proposed by theorists. She currently lives in Vienna and is a postdoc at the Institut fuer Hochenergiephysik, where she works with the members of the CMS Collaboration and with theorists.

She is active in public outreach most notably via her Twitter account. She also looks out for any other opportunities to let others know about science and in particular about particle physics.
