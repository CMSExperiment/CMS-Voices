                The <a href="http://cern.ch/cms">CMS Collaboration</a> at CERN, named after the Compact Muon Solenoid detector, is one of the largest international scientific collaborations in history, involving over 4000 particle physicists, engineers, technicians, students and support staff from around 200 universities and institutes from more than 40 countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The CMS detector is one of two general-purpose detectors at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that have been built to search for new physics. CMS is designed to detect a wide range of particles and phenomena produced in the LHC’s high-energy proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.

                The <a href="https://twitter.com/CMSvoices">@CMSvoices</a> project allows members of the public to engage with members of the CMS Collaboration via Twitter. You will hear from a new CMS Voice every month, speaking as themselves and talking about everything to do with life at CMS.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also follow bloggers from CMS on the <em><a href="http://cern.ch/cylindricalonion">Cylindrical Onion</a></em>.
